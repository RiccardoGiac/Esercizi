9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. 
The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: 
a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called 
describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, 
and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating 
that the restaurant is open. Make an instance called restaurant from your
